ToDo:
- default users/data script             DONE
- sign in/up pages                      DONE
- the main (first/default) view should
  be a list of posted blogs             DONE
- you can add a blog only if you're registered and signed in the app  DONE
    -> creating a blog 'author' is not required (get it from user info) DONE
    -> url is not required  DONE
    -> content should be a MD field NOT A PRIORITY?


- you should be able to like a blog only once
- Move cypress out of the FE project
- clicking on likes should list (pop up) the users who liked the post
- avatars 
- add a view model of the mongo collections
- TS ? neehh


very experimental:
- change DB to JSON storage ? why? and what about the backend
- changing the BD to json maybe we can automatize this app
to make it alive without needing a BEnd?
- oauth login?
- GH action to save the changes into the JSON DB


- other DB option would be a google spreedsheet?
(depending on how the MD editor goes)

- AWS serverless/lambda functions? (since they have generous free tier)
(good option to gain experience)
