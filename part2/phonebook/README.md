# Frontend phonebook application
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Navigate to the `part2/phonebook/` folder and run:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
By default the react application runs on the 3000 port and looks for a backend server on 3001 port.
